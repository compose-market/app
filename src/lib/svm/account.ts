/**
 * Deterministic Solana smart-account derivation from an EVM EOA.
 *
 * One EVM EOA ↔ one Solana smart account, forever.
 *
 *   EVM:  smartAccountAddress = CREATE2(factory, EOA)     → deterministic
 *   SVM:  swigWalletAddress = findSwigSystemAddressPda(   → deterministic PDA
 *           findSwigPda(hash(EOA)))
 *
 * The mapping is permanent — it's pure math (PDA derivation from a hash),
 * not a cached association. The same EVM EOA always produces the same
 * Solana wallet address on every device, every session, forever.
 *
 * The Swig account is controlled by the SAME secp256k1 key that controls
 * the EVM EOA (the personal/in-app wallet), registered as a `Secp256k1`
 * authority on the Swig program on-chain. Once created, the authority lives
 * on-chain permanently — no client-side persistence needed.
 *
 * Architecture:
 *   configPda  = findSwigPda(swigId)                  — Swig program config (internal)
 *   walletPda  = findSwigSystemAddressPda(configPda)  — where SOL/SPL tokens live (UI address)
 *
 * The wallet PDA is the SVM equivalent of the EVM smart account address.
 * It's what the user sees, funds, and what balance/settlement use.
 * The config PDA is internal — only used for Swig instruction building.
